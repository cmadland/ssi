## Quantitative Analysis and Results {-}

With respect to the research questions, no significant differences were detected between those who participated in the study buddy activity and those who did not participate, as outlined below.

## Research Question 1 {-}

**Do online graduate students who participate in a structured study buddy activity tend to use deep approaches in their learning?**

PASW Statistics ™ was used to compare the means of participants and non-participants with respect to their reported approach to learning scores. The R-SPQ-2F (Biggs et al., 2001) contains 20 Likert scale items that can be used to gauge whether students take a deep or a surface approach to their learning. In addition to the two main scales measuring deep and surface approaches, the survey contains four subscales measuring deep motives, deep strategies, surface motives, and surface strategies. The results can be calculated according to the subscales and/or the scales. Results of the independent samples t-test are shown in Table 7.

Table 7

Given the high significance values (p) in Table 7, it is very unlikely that any differences between the participants and non-participants on either the main scales or the sub-scales were due to anything other than chance. The hypothesis that students who participated in the study buddy activity would take deeper approaches to learning was not supported at the 0.05 level and therefore was rejected.

Furthermore, the fact that the mean score of the deep approach scale approached but did not exceed 40 for either the participants (37.8) or non-participants (36.3) group indicates that there may be room for improvement in encouraging deeper approaches. It is, however, encouraging that surface approach scores did not exceed 20. These results should be considered tentatively in the absence of any published norms and the small sample size.

## Research Question 2 {-}

**As a cooperative learning activity, does the study buddy activity provide sufficient scaffolding to promote deep approaches to learning?**

The second research question was reflective of the exploratory nature of the study in that there was no expectation of a difference between any of the four classes of participant groups in the study. Consequently, data were described rather than compared.

A key structural component of the study buddy activity is the description that the instructor uses to characterize different types of students. Richards (personal communication, n.d.) uses “bunnies” to describe those students who typically prefer to get their work done early and “bears” to describe those who usually finish their work at the last minute. He recommends that bunnies pair with bunnies and bears pair with bears to avoid the conflicts that may arise in a partnership with one who wants to complete the work early and the other who procrastinates and pushes the work to the deadline.
A summary of the data related to mix of bunnies and bears in this study is displayed in Table 8.

Table 8

Data were gathered in a manner that could not have indicated whether learners who identified as bears also preferred to work on their own, or if the cohorts from which these participants were recruited were more densely populated with bunnies, or if online graduate students are typically more bunny-ish than other populations. All three of these possibilities have implications for future research into the study buddy activity.

Data were gathered to explore the characteristics of the study buddy pairs and whether or not participants found the “bunny-bear” characterization to be helpful. These data are summarized in Table 9.

Table 9

The importance of partner compatibility was an interesting theme recurring throughout the quantitative and qualitative findings. Of the three participants who described themselves as “more of a bear” (Table 8), all three indicated that their partner had a different profile than their own, yet only one of the three reported having a bad experience in the study buddy activity.

Table 10

Three participants reported having a bad experience with the study buddy activity (Table 10), and all three had partners with different profiles, however, there were another four who reported having a good experience while their partners had a different profile. Furthermore, one of the participants who had a bad experience reported that their partner suddenly disengaged from the activity without notification (it was later learned that the partner who disappeared did so for medical reasons).

The findings were inconclusive on the question of the utility of the “bunny-bear” characterization and whether it was important for participants to have a similar partner. Indeed, only three (12%) of the participants indicated that the “bunny-bear” characterization was helpful. More than twice as many participants (n=7; 28%) disagreed that the characterization was helpful, and most (n=15; 60%) were ambivalent about the value of the characterization.

A key difference between asynchronous online and face-to-face learning environments is the greater need for clear, concise instructions in an asynchronous online environment. When an instructor is not physically or temporally present to answer questions about the details of an activity, it is incumbent upon the designer of the learning materials to ensure that the instructions for any activity are easy for the learners to understand. Table 11 summarizes the data with respect to the ease with which study buddy participants were able to understand the requirements and to engage with the activity.

Table 11

The findings indicate that the instructions for the study buddy activity were easy to follow and clear enough to allow potential participants to predict the amount of time the activity would require. The very high levels of reported effectiveness and willingness to participate again indicate that the study buddy participants were satisfied with the benefits they received for the work they put into the study buddy activity.

It is noteworthy that those who chose to not participate in the study buddy activity (Table 15) felt more strongly that the instructions were easy to understand (n=6; mean rating=4.17) than those who participated (n=25; mean rating=3.8). Non-participants appeared to have decided against participating in the activity primarily because they thought that the activity would take too much of their time.

With only three (12%) participants having reported a low quality experience with the study buddy activity, this investigation cannot answer the question of whether the number of times study buddy partners were in contact is an indicator of the quality of the experience. However, more than half (n=14; 56%) of the participants reported that they were in contact with their study buddy partner at least once per week (Table 12). With a total of four course assignments that were a part of the study buddy activity, this number is noticeably higher, both in the number of participants and the frequency of communication, than those who were in contact with their partner only when assignments were due.

Table 12

The idea that the frequency of interactions is a good sign is supported by the fact that 84% (n=21) of participants in the study indicated that they had a good experience throughout the study buddy activity. This finding was also supported in the qualitative analysis. As noted previously, the three participants who reported having a bad experience all had study buddy partners with a different profile. The one participant who reported that the experience was neither good nor bad had a partner who completely failed to engage in the process.

A clear majority of participants in this study (76%) reported that they thought that the study buddy should remain a formal part of the course, while the remaining 24% felt that potential participants should be allowed to form partnerships on their own terms (Table 12).

In retrospect, this question should not have been presented with a binary response; a third option should have been presented that allowed participants to indicate that they would recommend that the study buddy not be a part of the course at all. However, when participants were asked later in the survey whether or not they would recommend the study buddy activity for other students in other courses, only one of 18 participants who answered that question (6%) indicated that they would not recommend the activity.

## Research Question 3 {-}

**In what ways do students find value in the study buddy activity?**

Given the finding from the quantitative analysis that the study buddy activity did not significantly promote deeper approaches to learning, the third research question in this investigation became more important in order to determine the characteristics of the study buddy activity and its value for participants. A clearer understanding of how study buddy participants valued the activity may provide insight into how the activity could be improved to increase its effect on student approaches to learning.

Survey items were designed to align with Slavin’s (2011) integrated model of cooperative learning, which proposes the following four ways in which cooperative learning activities support improved learning:

- increased learner motivation,
- increased social cohesion,
- developmentally appropriate challenges, and
- increased cognitive elaboration.

Survey results, shown in table 13, revealed that participants credited the study buddy activity with providing a high level of social cohesion (mean score=4.12). Of particular interest was the finding that nearly all of the participants (96%) indicated that they wanted to help their partner, suggesting that one way to enhance the effect of cooperative learning activities is to capitalize on students’ altruism, i.e., their desire to help others in their class or group.

Table 13

The next most valued category was developmentally appropriate challenges (mean score=3.70), which reflected the importance of having partners who were both willing and able to provide meaningful feedback within their partner’s zone of proximal development.

The motivationalist perspective followed closely behind (mean score=3.62), followed lastly by the cognitive restructuring perspective (mean score=2.92). The low value attributed to the cognitive restructuring perspective was somewhat surprising. This finding was primarily due to the very few participants who reported disagreeing with their study buddy partner about important course concepts. However, even when this item was excluded from the data, the cognitive restructuring perspective remained the lowest with a mean score of 3.46.Considering that intellectual conflict is highly desirable if the goal is to promote critical thinking and clear communication (Johnson & Johnson, 1999a), especially given that this was a graduate-level course, it is notable that so few participants in the study reported disagreeing about course concepts. However, this lack of disagreement may have been due to the belief that study buddy partners were supposed to help each other, rather than challenge each other’s views. Perhaps intellectual conflict could be promoted to a greater degree by providing specific questions that study buddy partners could use to explore their partner’s views. It is possible that these types of questions are a key structure missing from the study buddy activity and that including them may promote deeper approaches to learning. Questions such as the following could be included:

- How did you come to that conclusion?
- How does this evidence support your conclusion?
- How do you know ‘X’ is true?
- Have you considered the evidence against your view?

Most of the findings regarding the aspects of the course that the study buddy activity might have helped to improve (Table 14) were positive, with one exception. Most participants indicated in their quantitative responses that the study buddy activity did not help them improve their professional understanding of what instructional design involved. This result was consistent with the previously reported benefits of the study buddy activity being primarily social as opposed to cognitive in nature (Table 13).

The final section of the survey, which asked whether or not participants would recommend the study buddy activity in other contexts showed that most of the participants (88%) would recommend the activity for MDDE 604 (the course in which the participants were enrolled), for other courses in the M.Ed. program, and as a general distance education strategy. 88% of participants answered in the affirmative for all three of these items. Only one respondent (6%) did not recommend the study buddy activity (Table 14).

Table 14

The non-participants in the study buddy activity (n=6) reported that they understood from the instructions what would be required to earn credit for the study buddy activity and that they primarily decided to not participate because of the time involved in the activity (Table 15). However, as there were only six participants in this study who did not participate in the study buddy activity, these results should be interpreted with caution and investigated further.

## Chapter Summary {-}

This chapter described the results of the analysis of the quantitative data, the first of two phases of analysis in this mixed methods investigation. Only the first research question allowed for the comparison of those research participants who participated in the study buddy activity and those who did not. An independent samples t-test was performed and there were no significant differences detected in the approach to learning employed by participants and non-participants. Data from the remaining two research questions were analyzed using descriptive statistics only.
