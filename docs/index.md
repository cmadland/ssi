# Exploring the Study Buddy Activity {-}

## Abstract {-}


This mixed methods study explored the characteristics of a cooperative learning activity, the “Study Buddy”, implemented in a graduate-level online course in instructional design. The study explored whether students (n=25) who participated in the Study Buddy activity took deeper approaches to their learning than those who did not participate (n=6), what value students received from participating in the activity, and whether the structure of the activity was appropriate to support deeper approaches to learning.

Quantitative and qualitative results were merged to form conclusions that suggest that participants could be encouraged to take deeper approaches by faculty providing sample questions for students to use to evaluate their partners’ work. Results suggest that the study buddy activity can be used to encourage social connections and to provide participants with opportunities to consider alternate opinions. Findings related to the ideal structure of the activity were inconclusive.

This thesis is, first of all, for my wife Kelly. Without her patience and support, I would not have been able to complete this degree. Also for my kids, Mixon, Selah, and Isaac, who have kept me laughing and sane throughout the process.

> I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use and by some other means to give us knowledge which we can attain by them. ~Galileo Galilei, (1615)

## Acknowledgements {-}


I would like to thank those who have supported this endeavour. Dr. Griff Richards, his encouragement to undertake this project, his skill in identifying potential areas of investigation, and his willingness to go to bat for me when needed have been instrumental in my development as a researcher and educator. Dr. Richard Kenny’s contributions to the development of the proposal were invaluable; I wish him all the best in his retirement. Dr. Susan Moisey, who agreed to join this effort half-way through, was gracious and thorough in her suggestions for improvement, and this thesis is better as a result of her contributions. Her words of encouragement were “Hang in there,” and they were more meaningful than I imagined three words could be. The staff and faculty of the Centre for Distance Education, including Leanne Jewell, Mawuli Kiuvi, Dr. Terry Anderson, Dr. Marguerite Koole, and my fellow students from across the globe have all played a part in this process. Finally, I owe a debt of gratitude to my friends, mentors, and colleagues at Thompson Rivers University, including Dr. Valerie Peachey, Sarah Langlois, Marie McGivern, and many others. Your support may have been unorthodox at times, but it was always appreciated.

Thank you, all.
